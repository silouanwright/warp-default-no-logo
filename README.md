# Warp Theme (No Logo)

The official Warp terminal theme with its signature blue accent and dark background, but with the Warp logo removed from the background image for a cleaner look.

## Installation

1. Copy the theme files to your Warp themes directory:
   ```bash
   cp warp.yaml ~/.warp/themes/
   cp warp.jpg ~/.warp/themes/
   ```

2. Open Warp settings (⌘+,)
3. Go to Appearance → Themes
4. Select "Warp" from the theme list

## Theme Colors

- **Accent**: `#5299bf` (Blue)
- **Background**: `#061229` (Dark Navy)
- **Foreground**: `#b8bbc2` (Light Gray)

## Features

- Original Warp theme colors and settings
- Custom background image with 60% opacity (Warp logo removed)
- Dark theme optimized for long coding sessions
- Carefully selected terminal colors for optimal readability

## Differences from Original

This theme is based on the official [Warp theme](https://github.com/warpdotdev/themes/tree/main/warp_bundled) that comes bundled with Warp Terminal.

This variant is identical to the official Warp theme except:
- The Warp logo has been masked out from the background image for a cleaner, distraction-free appearance
- All color values and settings remain exactly the same as the original
